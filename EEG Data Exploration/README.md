**Description**:
The present directory contains the notebooks developed with the objective of getting the better understanding of the EEG Dataset and the MNE Library, and getting the more knowledge to extract the necessary features to finally implement the classification model.

Here you can find the following notebooks:
1. **Explore the Dataset and MNE Library**: This notebooks is a summary about what is the content of the Dataset obtained from OpenNeuro Platform, in addition, the initial and basic usage of MNE Library created to handle EEG data.
2. **EEG Windows**: Due to the EEG Data can be difficult to handle and understand, and due to this data are a Time Series representation, this allow us to create windows from the data and perform a better aproach to maintain the relationship in the features extracted over the time.

Next Step after the Data Exploration is `Feature Extraction`
