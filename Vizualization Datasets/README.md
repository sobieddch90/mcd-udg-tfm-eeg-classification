**Description**:
This section contains additional information such as dashboards and charts that was used to understand the data and interpret the results.\

1. The first work was a dashboard created with the data filtered by each frequency band using Python MNE library in [Feature Extraction PSD - Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/sobieddch90/mcd-udg-tfm-eeg-classification/blob/main/Vizualization%20Datasets/Comparison%20EEG%20Signals%20by%20Group.pdf) notebook, and then using the dataset in Tableau tool to plot the data. Due to the high weight of the Dataset, the file wasn't be uploaded to the Reporsitory. The dashboard uploaded can be found as part of this directory with the name `Comparison EEG Signals by Group.pdf`.
